Let $$G$$ be a group and $$R$$ a ring. 
The group ring $$R[G]$$ is the ring consisting of formal sums 
\\[ \sum_{g \in G} r_g g \\] 
where $$r_g \in R$$ and $$r_g \neq 0$$ for a finite number of $$r_g$$s, so that we don't get infinite sums.
Addition is defined pointwise: 
\\[\sum_{g \in G} r_g g + \sum_{g \in G} s_g g = \sum_{g \in G} (r_g + s_g) g \\]
and multiplication is defined as the convolution:
\\[\left(\sum_{g \in G} r_g g\right)\left(\sum_{h \in G} r_h h\right) = \sum_{z \in G} \left(\sum_{gh = z} r_g r_h \right) z \\] 
As for the notation, polynomial rings are a special case. 
Let $$G$$ be the free abelian group generated by the elements $$X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$$. 
Then $$R[G] \cong R[X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n]$$.
Even free abelian groups are a special case: a free abelian group on $$G$$ is simply the underlying additive group of $$\mathbb Z[G]$$.[^1] 

[^1]: Only the order of $$G$$ matters here, since the group structure only comes into play when we consider multiplication of elements of $$R[G]$$. So for a free abelian group on $$n$$ elements, one can pick any group of order $$n$$.
