In this post I show how to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of [YouTube](https://youtube.com).
## Steps:

- Remove comment sections:
  - Install AdBlock ([Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adblock-plus/), [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom)), and then click on any video.
  - Right click on the comment section, click "Block this ad", and move the slider to the right till it blocks the whole comment section. It should look like something like this:

  <figure>
  <a href="/assets/img/adblock.png"><img class="invertible" src="/assets/img/adblock.png">A screenshot of AdBlock</a>
  </figure>

- Block distracting channels:
  - Get a video/channel blocker extension ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-blocker/jknkjnpcbbgcbdbaampbjlhkcghmgfhk?hl=en), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/video-blocker/))
  - Block all distracting channels, by right clicking on their videos and then clicking "Block videos from this channel".

- Unsubscribe from those distracting channels that you're subscribed to (you know you are).

And that's how you make YouTube much less distracting than it was before.
