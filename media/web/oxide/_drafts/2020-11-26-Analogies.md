# Introduction
<div class="epigraph" markdown="1">
> "A resemblance of relations; an agreement or likeness between things in some circumstances or effects, when the things are otherwise entirely different. Thus, learning *enlightens* the mind, because it is to the mind what *light* is to the eye, enabling it to discover things before hidden."

If two things are *analogous*, it means that locally, the [directed graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph) of their relations to other things are quite similar.[^1]
In this essay, I will talk about the use and abuse of analogies.

[^1]: That the similarity is *local* is essential, although in simpler cases they may also be global, which is the source of [John Baez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Baez)'s “Every sufficiently precise analogy is yearning to be a [functor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functor)”.


# Analogies as explanations
My chemistry teacher in high school prefers to explain things mostly by analogy to human behaviour.
For example, electrons in the outer orbits of an atom experience a weaker [binding force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization_energy) as compared to those in the inner orbits, similar to how students sitting at the back of the classoom are less likely to pay attention.

Such explanations are highly tempting, especially from a pedagogical perspective.
They are easy to construct, and after hearing them you may *feel* like you have understood something, but this is an illusion.

For any possible state of the world there may be constructed any supporting analogy.
This, by itself, disproves analogies as an explanatory tool.

# Wrong analogies
The [pigeonhole principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle) states that if you have $$n$$ holes and $$n+1$$ pigeons to put them in, at least 1 hole will have more than one pigeon.
It's a trite observation that nonetheless finds various surprising uses in mathematics.
But we are only surprised because of how salient in our minds the *active* process of distribution is, which makes it a poor analogy in more 'passive' situations, and therefore harder to immediately recognise.

A better version, proposed by Dijkstra, is: “In a finite set of real numbers, the maximum is at least the average”.[^pigeon]
He [wrote](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD10xx/EWD1094.html):

[^pigeon]: The pigeonhole principle is a special case of this, by taking the set to be $$\{1,1,…,1,2\}$$, for example.
> The thing we observe is that the "objects" and the "compartments" have disappeared. 
> That is a great improvement, for it saves us the needless trouble of making a painful identification in all those circumstances in which (for visual or linguistic reasons) the metaphor of objects and compartments does not fit nicely.

So in a sense, the "pigeonhole" analogy is wrong because it emphasizes precisely the wrong things.
