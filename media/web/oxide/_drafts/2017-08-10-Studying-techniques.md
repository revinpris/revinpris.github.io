Using productivity techniques is great, but if you leverage your own concentration and habits, you will maximise your efficiency.[^1] [^2]

[^1]: Aliquam nec tincidunt ipsum. Etiam nec lacus tincidunt velit sodales vulputate. Praesent quam mi, consectetur vel aliquam eu, vulputate sit amet diam. Suspendisse tincidunt tellus quis leo vulputate, quis suscipit risus gravida. Aenean pulvinar tortor non leo viverra, id aliquet erat congue.
[^2]: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Ut at tempus sapien. Sed nec nunc a dui vehicula pellentesque non ut lacus. Praesent in lorem non risus posuere volutpat. Maecenas nec finibus eros, suscipit dictum dolor. Nam sit amet molestie sapien, sit amet ornare nisi. Cras dapibus ipsum dui, et semper mi tempor a. Aliquam quis luctus lorem, eget viverra ex. Donec sit amet neque eros. Mauris luctus augue ultrices, sagittis eros et, finibus mi. Quisque vitae euismod dolor.



The most touted technique is to use the Pomodoro technique, which is effective, but not completely. So you must change it to reflect your own needs.
# Changing your study sessions

- First, do a study session and set a stopwatch at the start, and find out at which point (in minutes) you begin to daydream/procrastinate. Call that number $$x$$.
- Round off $$x$$ to the nearest multiple of thirty . Call this number $$y$$.
- From $$y$$, subtract ⅕th of $$x$$. Call this number $$z$$.

Now, you have just created your own studying framework, in which you study for $$x$$ minutes, take a break for $$z$$ minutes and it nicely adds up to an easily measurable number $$y$$.

*This is your own version of the Pomodoro technique personalized for your own attention span. Try to do this experiment every 2 months, so you can increase your attention span.*[^osama]

[^osama]:
    ```haskell
    -- Hello world example:
    module Main where

    data = ()
    type = String
    year = 2020 / 1.0 * 1

    studio = 10 + 10.0 + 10e0 + 0o10 + 0x10 -- → 54

    main :: IO ()
    main = print "Hello World!"
    ```

I recommend the [Cornell note taking system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_Notes).
When you take notes in that system, save the summary section for writing after the lecture/class. This forces you to revise the material that was taught.
But when you do write it, don't just write it off the top of your head. First use the [Feynman technique](https://youtu.be/_f-qkGJBPts) to summarize the whole lesson, and do it at least twice. And then, write the summary. What this does is exercise your understanding of the material and quickly identifies your weak spots.

## Alternative

If you can't write your notes in the Cornell system, or rewrite them, you can still use the Feynman technique to summarize them, or draw cause-effect diagrams, and try to express the ideas as simply as you can. For example, for history, you can draw cause, effect and consequence diagrams, and in mathematics, you can write down the most important formulae, or the main idea behind a theorem and its proofs, &c.
# Changing your studying system

Now, place these notes in your [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) basket, for later review.[^5] Not only will you complete your later revision faster, but you will have to study *less* than if you had normally done it, and *still understand more*, at just the expense of one experiment, a switch of a note taking system and summarizing your lectures.


# Bringing it all together

Here's how you use the aforementioned techniques to study most efficiently out of anyone you know.
- Your sessions *must* use your own version of the pomodoro technique.
- In said session, you must summarize your lecture notes, using the Cornell note system, as best as you can using the Feynman technique.
- Use the notes and summaries for easy review before exams.

# Additional tips

Remember that your physical health, your diet, and your mental health are just as important factors for your grades as your study habits. 
If you neglect these, your cognitive ability will go down. 
For example, if you sleep 6 hours a night for 14 days straight, you'll have the cognitive ability of someone with a blood alcohol level of 0.1%.[^6]

[^6]: Williamson AM, Feyer A. [“Moderate sleep deprivation produces impairments in cognitive and motor performance equivalent to legally prescribed levels of alcohol intoxication”](https://oem.bmj.com/content/oemed/57/10/649.full.pdf). *Occupational and Environmental Medicine*  2000; **57**:649-655. 
<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">todo</span>: add more examples of sleep deprivation and cognitive deterioration

So as some general guidelines, that you should always follow regardless of exams:
- Get a good night's sleep. Don't pull all nighters. Seriously.
- Don't cram, and don't study the last day for an exam.
- Eat well. If you're eating crap, then you'll feel like crap. Have a healthy diet.
- Do a form of physical exercise such as sports.
- Keep your mind mentally stimulated, either by reading, or some other activity.

    [20 rules of formulating effective knowledge](https://www.supermemo.com/en/archives1990-2015/articles/20rules), Piotr Wozniak:
>
1. Do not learn if you do not understand.
1. Learn before you memorize—build the picture of the whole before you dismember it into simple items in SuperMemo. If the whole shows holes, review it again.
1. Build upon the basics—never jump both feet into a complex manual because you may never see the end. Well remembered basics will help the remaining knowledge easily fit in.
1. Stick to the minimum information principle—if you continue forgetting an item, try to make it as simple as possible. If it does not help, see the remaining rules (cloze deletion, graphics, mnemonic techniques, converting sets into enumerations, etc.)
1. [Cloze deletion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloze_deletion) is easy and effective—completing a deleted word or phrase is not only an effective way of learning. Most of all, it greatly speeds up formulating knowledge and is highly recommended for beginners.
1. Use imagery—a picture is worth a thousand words.
1. Use [mnemonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic) techniques—read about peg lists and mind maps. Study the books by Tony Buzan. Learn how to convert memories into funny pictures. You won't have problems with phone numbers and complex figures.
1. Graphic deletion is as good as cloze deletion—obstructing parts of a picture is great for learning anatomy, geography and more.
1. Avoid sets—larger sets are virtually un-memorizable unless you convert them into enumerations.
1. Avoid enumerations—enumerations are also hard to remember but can be dealt with using cloze deletion.
1. Combat interference—even the simplest items can be completely intractable if they are similar to other items. Use examples, context cues, vivid illustrations, refer to emotions, and to your personal life.
1. Optimize wording—like you reduce mathematical equations, you can reduce complex sentences into smart, compact and enjoyable maxims.
1. Refer to other memories—building memories on other memories generates a coherent and hermetic structure that forgetting is less likely to affect. Build upon the basics and use planned redundancy to fill in the gaps.
1. Personalize and provide examples—personalization might be the most effective way of building upon other memories. Your personal life is a gold mine of facts and events to refer to. As long as you build a collection for yourself, use personalization richly to build upon well established memories.
1. Rely on emotional states—emotions are related to memories. If you learn a fact in the sate of sadness, you are more likely to recall it if when you are sad. Some memories can induce emotions and help you employ this property of the brain in remembering.
1. Context cues simplify wording—providing context is a way of simplifying memories, building upon earlier knowledge and avoiding interference.
1. Redundancy does not contradict minimum information principle—some forms of redundancy are welcome. There is little harm in memorizing the same fact as viewed from different angles. Passive and active approach is particularly practicable in learning word-pairs. Memorizing derivation steps in problem solving is a way towards boosting your intellectual powers!
1. Provide sources—sources help you manage the learning process, updating your knowledge, judging its reliability, or importance.
1. Provide date stamping—time stamping is useful for volatile knowledge that changes in time.
1. Prioritize—effective learning is all about prioritizing. In incremental reading you can start from badly formulated knowledge and improve its shape as you proceed with learning (in proportion to the cost of inappropriate formulation). If need be, you can review pieces of knowledge again, split it into parts, reformulate, reprioritize, or delete.
